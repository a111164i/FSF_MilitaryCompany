Attack Carrier,aEP_AttackCarrier,FSF Design,,"To send fighters faster and farther, all fighters on this ship are equipped with induction coils to receive a boost.",,
Strafe,aEP_Strafe,FSF Design,,"This ship slowly regenerates strafe energy. Whenever a large weapon is on cooldown, consume strafe energy to eliminate the remaining cooldown time.

Fully recharging strafe energy takes %s seconds; when fully charged, it can eliminate %s seconds of cooldown. After elimination, the shortest possible fire interval is %s.

If this ship's system is out of charge, it immediately consumes %s of strafe energy to regain a charge.

Each time this ship uses its system, it fires several low-power built-in missiles to distract the enemy.",,
Explosive Reactive Armor,aEP_ReactiveArmor,FSF Design,Defenses,"Explosive reactive armor (ERA) is embedded beneath the main armor belt, designed to respond to severe impacts.

When the hull sustains damage equal to or greater than %s, the ERA activates, consuming one unit of ammo and mitigating that damage by %s. The ship has a total of %s ERAs.",,
Composite Targeting System,aEP_TargetSystem,FSF Design,,"A composite targeting system combines laser, radio, and optic rangefinder technologies, providing substantial range bonuses similar to those of a capital ship.

Ballistic/energy non-PD weapon range is enhanced by %s and PD weapon range is enhanced by %s. However, range bonus exceeding %s is reduced by %s.",,
High Speed Maneuver,aEP_HighSpeedManeuver,FSF Design,,"The compact design of this ship enables it to weave between bullets, though not for extended periods.",,
Multi-turret Optimization,aEP_HLMultiTurret,FSF Design,,"Part of the weapon structure is built into the slots.

Ballistic/energy weapon OP costs, from small to large, are reduced by %s/ %s/ %s.",,
Close Targeting,aEP_CloseTargeting,FSF Design,,"A PD-oriented targeting system helps PD weapons on smaller ships perform as effectively as those on capital ships.

PD weapon range %s, all ballistic/energy weapon recoil and max spread %s, projectile speed %s.

This ship deals significantly less damage to allies.",,
Titanic Killer,aEP_TitanicKiller,FSF Design,,"A dreadnought is designed to defeat a formidable opponent.

Based on hull size, if the target's base DP exceeds a certain threshold, for every few DP beyond that point, the damage increases by %s per step, up to a maximum of %s.",,
Twin Fighter,aEP_TwinFighter,FSF Design,,The gunnery module at the front of the ship is an individual fighter that can be launched to coordinate and attack targets on the flank.,,

Elite Ship,aEP_EliteShip,FSF Design,Defenses,"This modification aimed to maximize the ship's defense, including a complete overhaul of all mechanical parts, using micro-drones to detect and fix even the smallest leaks within pipelines, and replacing the main armor belt with a superior material.

In addition to these standard improvements, a backup overload response system has been installed. This system includes a disposable drone that can deploy a ship-sized shield until the ship recovers.",,
Emergency Reconstruct,aEP_EmergencyReconstruct,FSF Design,Defenses,"Inspired by an automated ship design, an entire set of scaffolding is placed into compressed phase space. Once the ship sustains lethal damage, it initiates an emergency reconstruction process to fully restore its hull points and armor.",,
Controlled Shield,aEP_ShieldControlled,FSF Design,Shields,"The specialized shield generator cooperates with the targeting system to harden the shield just before impact. However, it is incapable of tracking projectiles fired at close range.",,
Floating Shield,aEP_ShieldFloating,FSF Design,Shields,"A specialized shield generator produces a liquid-like surface; the harder the impact, the more efficient it becomes.",,
Hot Loader,aEP_HotLoader,FSF Design,Weapons,"The recoil recycling device designed by the company exploits potential space to expand the magazine, thereby boosting ammunition regeneration.
