Open Field Hanger,aEP_OpenFieldHangar,FSF Design,,"The large open deck at the center of the ship allows for the deployment of more fighters in a wing, but doubling the workload for a single LPC chip slightly reduces its performance.

All non-built-in wings will be infinitely redeployed to %s, but they deal %s damage to enemy ships.",,
Accelerated Gunnery,aEP_AcceleratedGunnery,FSF Design,,"The fine-tuned control chip accelerates all movements related to weapon cycling. Only ships pre-built with above-average steel can withstand its long-term side effects.

Attack Carrier,aEP_AttackCarrier,FSF Design,,"Built to send fighters directly to enemy ships means high lost rate. To compensate the deficit in fighter refit rate, this ship can shortly overload its fighter forge quickly replacing all lost. Can't overload twice in short time and generate soft flux during cooldown",,
Strafe,aEP_Strafe,FSF Design,,"This ship slowly regenerates strafe energy. Whenever a large weapon on the ship fires, consume strafe energy to accelerate its remaining cooldown.

Fully recharging strafe energy takes %s seconds; when fully charged, it can reduce %s seconds of cooldown in total and weapons with fire interval shorter than %s can't be accelerated.

If this ship's system is out of charge, it will consume %s of strafe energy to regain a charge. Everytime shipsystem activates, fires several low-power built-in missiles to distract enemy point defenses.",,
Pre-planted Explosive Reactive Armor,aEP_ReactiveArmor,FSF Design,Defenses,"Explosive reactive armors (ERAs) are embedded beneath the main armor belt, designed to respond to severe impacts.

When the hull takes a damage that >= %s, one ERA activates, mitigating that damage by %s. The ship has a total of %s ERAs.",,"Reduces number of ERAs by %s"
Composite Targeting System,aEP_TargetSystem,FSF Design,,"A composite targeting system combines laser, radio, and optic rangefinding technologies, providing range bonuses similar to capital ship level.

Boosts non-PD weapons range by %s and PD weapon range by %s. However, weapon range beyond %s is reduced by %s.",,
High Speed Maneuver,aEP_HighSpeedManeuver,FSF Design,,"The compact hull and high speed of this ship allow it to dodge attacks, but keep doing so burden the engine and will eventually fail unless let engine get some rest.",,
Multi-turret Optimization,aEP_HLMultiTurret,FSF Design,,"Part of the weapon structure is built into the slots.

Ballistic/energy weapon OP costs, from small to large, are reduced by %s/ %s/ %s.",,
Close Targeting,aEP_CloseTargeting,FSF Design,,"A PD-oriented targeting system helps PD weapons on smaller ships perform as effectively as those on capital ships.

Boosts PD weapon range by %s, optimize weapon recoil and spread by %s.",,
Titanic Killer,aEP_TitanicKiller,FSF Design,,"A dreadnought is designed to defeat an elite opponent.

Based on hull size, if the target's base DP exceeds a certain threshold, for every few DP above this ship deals %s damage, to a maximum of %s.",,
Twin Fighter,aEP_TwinFighter,FSF Design,,The gunnery module at the front of the ship is an individual fighter that can be launched to coordinate and attack targets on the flank.,,

Elite Ship,aEP_EliteShip,FSF Design,Defenses,"This modification aimed to maximize the ship's defense, including a complete overhaul of all mechanical parts, using micro-drones to detect and fix even the smallest leaks within pipelines, and replacing the main armor belt with a superior material.

In addition to these standard improvements, a backup overload response system has been installed. This system includes a disposable drone that can deploy a ship-sized shield until the ship recovers.",,
Emergency Reconstruct,aEP_EmergencyReconstruct,FSF Design,Defenses,"Inspired by an automated ship design, an entire set of scaffolding is placed into compressed phase space. Once the ship sustains lethal damage, it initiates an emergency reconstruction process to fully restore its hull points and armor.",,
Controlled Shield,aEP_ShieldControlled,FSF Design,Shields,"The specialized shield generator cooperates with the targeting system to harden the shield just before impact. However, it is incapable of tracking projectiles fired at close range.

For non-missile projectiles and beams that spawned outside %s su, shield damage taken %s. For missiles, shield damage taken %s. Weapon's base range are limited to %s.",,
Floating Shield,aEP_ShieldFloating,FSF Design,Shields,"A specialized shield generator produces a liquid-like surface; the harder the impact, the more efficient it becomes.

For every %s flux raised due to shield absorbing damage, in the next %s seconds gains a small amount of shield damage reduction. This effect is stackable and damage reduction scales exponentially, to max of %s stacks where shield damage taken %s",,
Hot Loader,aEP_HotLoader,FSF Design,Weapons,"The recoil recycling device designed by the company exploits potential space to expand the magazine, thereby boosting ammunition regeneration.

Weapons' ammo regeneration speed %s",,Ammo regen speed bonus changes to %s
Vanguard Hull,aEP_VanguardHull,FSF Design,Defenses,"Improving the hull's hardness has been proven to offer little resistance against large anti-ship guns, but it significantly reduces damage from numerous smaller impacts.

Each time the hull takes damage, there is a %s chance to reduce it by %s.",,"Trigger chance changes to %s, damage reduction changes to %s"
Strategy Thruster,aEP_StrategyThruster,FSF Design,Engines,Being quicker in long-range repositioning is key to gaining a strategic advantage. This engine modification improves zero flux boost capability but comes at the expense of combat performance.,,
