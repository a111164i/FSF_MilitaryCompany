Eventually, you stop at a conference room where a presentation seems to have taken place earlier.

The company then sent a medium-sized combat fleet to recover it, only for a firefight to ensue.""

$heOrShe hands you the tablet and says, ""The results are in this report. After suffering light losses, the fleet commander judged that although he could have won the engagement, he would have incurred a lot of unnecessary damage.

""Yes, this is a very special drone ship, and I desperately need the data for the program. Theoretically, deploying a Company force to retrieve it would be the best course of action. However, it's equally important to keep it out of the hands of other powers. This brings me to my second point: a medium battle fleet, followed immediately by a large battle fleet heading towards the same location, will be the talk of the sector, regardless of what they retrieve. That's why it would cause more trouble if the Company were to undertake this mission instead of you.
