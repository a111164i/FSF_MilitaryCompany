$personFirstName stands by and waits for you to finish examining the strange ship, before making a gesture, causing the holographic projection to begin playing out in full.

$heOrShe hands you the tablet and says, ""The results are on this report.

""Yes, this is a very special drone ship and I need the data very badly for the program, so theoretically deploying a Company force to retrieve it would be the best course of action. But it is equally important to keep it out of the hands of other powers. Which brings me to my second point - a medium battle fleet followed immediately by a large battle fleet heading towards the same place will be the talk of the sector no matter what they bring back. That's why this would be a lot more trouble if it were the company, instead of you, doing it - no one is going to be watching where independent captains are flying all day, and it's better to let this drone remain a secret than provoke a troublesome scuffle over it.""",,

Seeing your half-hearted look, $personFirstName doesn't show you any more information, but continues, ""Aside from the unreasonable shields, the rest of the ship, like its counterparts in the sector, can simply be called 'serviceable' - which means it shouldn't be too difficult for you to take it apart.""
