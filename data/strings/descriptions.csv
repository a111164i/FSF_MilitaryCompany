aEP_cap_sta_main,WEAPON,"Another milestone in the company's gunpowder-driven ballistic weapon development is achieved. It aims to compete with the latest Domain-era reality-disturbing weapons. From our current perspective, this new weapon delivers the same level of destruction at 50 times the cost to build and cannot be mounted on any universal ship slot.

To operate this gun properly, you first need disposable drones. Due to the massive caliber and weight of the warhead, secondary propellants are ignited in sequence to maintain high pressure in the barrel. After the warhead exits the muzzle, a formation of electromagnetic accelerator drones propels the projectile to space-level velocity. It is rumored that this weapon can burn sensors just with the explosion's whiteout. It is currently deployed on the company's star fortress. This weapon embodies the tenet of FSF gunnery design: traditional design is never outdated.

aEP_cap_duiliu,SHIP,"A recent addition to the fleet, this capital ship symbolizes the company's power and represents a fresh face among many seasoned designs. For a long time, the company's primary warships were relics from the Domain era. With the emergence of the FSF as a formidable force in the sector, it became apparent that a warship tailored specifically for the corporation was needed. Thus, this ship was born. It sacrifices thick armor and high speed for densely packed weapon slots, and when timed right, it can annihilate opponents purely through overwhelming firepower. This vessel will represent the FSF in further battles against peer adversaries.

The term ""thermocline"" refers to rapid and drastic changes within a short period. In the hands of a brave captain, a single confrontation can lead to a decisive victory without the need for prolonged exchanges. In the narrow contest of battle, only those who truly believe in their success will earn the favor of the goddess of victory.",,,,
aEP_cap_nuanchi,SHIP,"Resembling a haphazard collection of engines strapped to an asteroid, the ship truly earns its designation as a missile capital ship. Scaling up a micro-missile factory to full size incurs significant costs. Not only is the space for expanding missile racks minimized, but the area designated for storing conventional spare ammunition is also occupied. However, over extended battlefield engagements, the continuous regeneration of missiles from the full-sized missile factory proves invaluable.

Despite its chaotic appearance, the designers thoughtfully considered impact mitigation and damage control in its hull structure. Ammunition is stored uniformly, providing not only decent armor but also minimizing the risk of catastrophic self-destruction when damaged.

Furthermore, the ship is designed to incorporate the 'Refresh' reloading system. This innovative loading device, which uses standardized ammunition supply modules, quickly delivers ammunition from various parts of the hull to the missile launchers, allowing the ship to achieve an astonishing rate of fire in a short period. Such a missile ship is awe-inspiring at all times.",,,,
aEP_cap_biaobing,SHIP,"If the Paragon-class is a product of the naval fantasies of high-ranking officers and the ambitious aspirations of Tri-Tachyon's top echelons, then the Exemplar-class represents a pragmatic step toward the generalization of battleships. Unlike the Paragon-class, which spares no expense in using advanced targeting cores, the Exemplar-class employs a set of shooting-assist radars designed specifically to address the issue of insufficient range for energy weapons.

Despite making significant sacrifices, the Exemplar-class cannot sustain its radar at full power for an extended period. This limitation means that in one-on-one engagements, most old-school ballistic battleships can easily suppress it as long as they maintain an advantageous firing range. In comparison to energy warships that require a large number of highly skilled technicians to maintain advanced targeting cores, the Exemplar-class is a return to the traditional battleships of old-simple and practical.

The Exemplar-class should not appear in the sector because neither the battle group stationed there nor the Fourteenth that came to replace it was equipped with Exemplar-class ships. However, it mysteriously appears on the FSF's inventory. Despite various circulating rumors, one thing is certain: the founders of FSF must have had close ties with certain high-ranking members of the legions before the Collapse, allowing them to acquire the blueprints of military-grade ships.",,,,
aEP_cap_neibo,SHIP,"The Pycnocline-class battleship cruiser was designed to hunt down smaller vessels, setting itself apart from the company's typically slow but heavily armed ships. It employs a pulse burst propulsion system that propels this massive chunk of steel almost instantaneously. Another unique design feature is the turret module attached to the main gun, which is equipped with independent weapons and flux systems, guaranteeing reliable firing power during close encounters.

Despite being classified as a battleship cruiser, its armor and structural integrity are slightly superior to the company's standard battleships, giving the Pycnocline-class a somewhat awkward standing. As a flagship with an unconventional design, the abundance of small slots doesn't bode well for withstanding damage. In evenly matched battles, the Pycnocline-class is prone to encountering the issue of having 'no guns available.' However, the massive damage potential of the main gun is extremely perilous for medium and small ships, posing a significant challenge for captains when selecting their opponents.",,,,
aEP_cap_decomposer,SHIP,"One of the newly developed ships following the Collapse, the Decomposer-class, is designed to carry a substantial amount of fuel and supplies, and is equipped with an open deck and construction yard. The initial design aims to support long-range fleets in situations where resupply is unavailable. By dismantling salvaged wreckage on the battlefield for usable parts and various consumables, it significantly alleviates logistical pressures for armies with less efficient logistical systems. In the event of supply shortages, an elite fleet equipped with such ships can sustain itself for a considerable amount of time.

After a ship comes to a stop on the battlefield, if the hull has not completely disintegrated due to self-destruction, many internal components can be recovered. Typically, only after the battle's outcome is determined will one side gain the authority to clean up the battlefield. By that time, many items requiring sealed storage may have scattered into space and become unrecoverable. Equipped with disassembly beams from built-in drones, the Decomposer-class can precisely break down wreckage into appropriately sized debris and carry them back to the operation deck for recovery.

To ensure uninterrupted operations, the Decomposer-class's firepower is sufficient to repel smaller ships. As such, this versatile ship can serve as the core of a small fleet.

Despite using materials for armor and structure that meet military-grade standards, the Decomposer-class sacrifices space for shield generators to meet the requirements of both cargo transport and disassembly operations. Instead, it utilizes an integrated group of shielding drones to absorb damage.",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu,SHIP,"An armored cargo ship traverses the sector, employed only when dealing with the most dangerous routes. The quality of its armor and structure rivals that of most battleships, allowing it to disregard many threats. As a star in the specialized transport industry, it boasts formidable firepower and, when necessary, can deploy its armor to withstand a significant amount of fire until reinforcements arrive.

However, its expensive supply requirements and the effort needed to maintain its folding armor exceed expectations. But that is not the main concern. Designed with structural strength comparable to military standards, it is not destined for routine back-and-forth on peaceful routes. Instead, it belongs to the unpredictable, pirate-infested, poorly-charted border routes where its robust structure is most suited.",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu_mk3,SHIP,"This is a modified Upwelling-class vessel, crafted by a departed FSF designer. The modifications include the removal of the retractable external armor, which has been replaced in the original cargo hold area with a series of gun galleries and auxiliary engines.

The Upwelling-class rarely becomes the target of pirate attacks, and even when it does, it rarely ends up as a victim. Since its inception, there have been only a few documented instances of loss. The appearance of this warship is surrounded by off-the-record stories. However, it is evident that the creator of these substantial modifications closely aligned with official standards.",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu_mk2,SHIP,"This variant, based on the Upwelling-class, is specifically designed for transporting antimatter fuel. Statistical data from the specialized fuel transport sector indicate that the risk reduction achieved by minimizing exposure in high-risk areas far outweighs the benefits of adding additional layers of armor. However, the MK.II model incorporated both strategies. It is powered by a colossal driver system formed by the parallel connection of multiple large engines, surpassing any conventional option in both size and fuel consumption. After an extended acceleration phase, it can traverse battlefields at speeds that leave destroyers far behind.

The fuel required to operate this immense engine is directly sourced from the MK.II's own cargo, resulting in an actual effective payload lower than the stated capacity. Although it may consume half of its cargo while crossing hazardous zones, reaching the destination intact is considered a success for its clients.",,,,

aEP_cru_hailiang,SHIP,"This is a cruiser designed to resemble a space station battery platform, equipped with numerous slots. It is intended for the suppression of wolf pack ships, featuring large slots in every direction to provide significant advantages in range and firepower.",,,,
aEP_cru_zhongliu,SHIP,"Becoming the backbone of the company's fleet, this ship, designed as a conventional cruiser, embodies the distinctive features of company vessels. Although its armor is only slightly stronger than that of a light cruiser and it lacks crucial maneuverability, making it a relatively easy target, it excels in coordination. When operating in tandem with supportive ships, the Mainstream-class can easily neutralize any adversary with its wide, overlapping large slots.",,,,
aEP_cru_requan,SHIP,"As a lightweight version of the Warmpool-class, the easily producible Thermalvent-class offers a limited number of slots. This means it can be easily handled by any ship that approaches its vicinity, even the smallest frigates. Despite its numerous drawbacks, the low deployment cost alone is enough to make it a favored choice for fleet commanders.",,,,
aEP_cru_pingding,SHIP,"The Pacifier-class is not commonly seen in the FSF fleet due to its highly specialized design, typically deployed only for besieging the most challenging targets. These bombardment ships, equipped with rocket-boosted weapons, can destroy most vessels from beyond the sensor range of their fire control systems. While the Pacifier-class has never been used in major conflicts since its debut mission to destroy a pirate station, these game-changers are always taken into consideration by the enemies of the FSF.",,,,
aEP_cru_shanhu,SHIP,"Originally designed to enhance the aerial combat capabilities of the company's fleet, this support carrier initially boasted superior maximum speed and cost-efficient deployment. However, ongoing discussions and enhancements have transformed it into a multifunctional marvel. Integrated with missile platforms and ADS drone launching systems, working on this ship is an unparalleled experience. Despite its high cost, the ship exhibits no weaknesses, confidently handling the maintenance of missiles, aircraft, and ADS drones without compromise.",,,,
aEP_cru_baojiao,SHIP,"The Barrier-class is specifically designed for large-scale fleet battles. It can be constructed using some of the most common materials and technologies found within the sector. Its mass production capability has earned it a mixed reputation.It is said that the prototype design was an advanced research vessel capable of projecting a damper field onto ship-sized targets, but this system never made it out of the laboratory.",,,,
aEP_cru_pubu,SHIP,"The latest developed siege carrier, utilizing a high-power drive launcher to catapult aircraft into the distance, features a complex set of mechanical motion components to ensure the smooth operation of the central guide rail system. The Waterfall-class demands the highest level of expertise from its crew. Any mistake in maintaining either the fragile launch guide or the precision linkage structure can render it inoperative. The positioning of the Waterfall-class as an offensive carrier belies the challenges it faces in battlefield operations. Crew members following routine procedures from a safe distance often find it difficult to imagine the extent of the disasters they may cause.

Preferred by top students, the prototype of the Waterfall-class traces its origins to the reverse engineering of the wreckage of a severely damaged aerospace cruiser. The study revealed cylindrical tracks and boiler mechanisms that were believed to function as a steam catapult, along with numerous structures resembling a forge. The radiation and high-temperature environment had severely damaged the hull of the wreckage. Currently, all information about it is speculative and may deviate completely from the original design intent. The only confirmed information is the inscription 'Iron Pavilion' written on the cabin wall.",,,,

aEP_des_taodong,SHIP,"A nimble destroyer reverse-engineered from a salvaged prototype. When the mysterious ship known as the 'Miko' was first recovered by a salvage team, its ever-changing shell colors with each measurement defied the known laws of physics, causing the collapse of current scientific theories within the company. The interior, adorned with textures resembling magical glyphs, seemed to mock human ignorance and arrogance.

Through various technological means, including an inertia-driven propulsion system that shakes untrained crew members to the point of nausea, and a weapon overload mechanism allowing 30 seconds of firing followed by half an hour of reloading, the company has managed to replicate some aspects of the legendary destroyer.

This has sparked philosophical contemplation. Can the first test ship, reconstructed from the wreckage itself with a replacement part rate of 100%, still be considered the same ship as the original prototype?",,,,

aEP_des_youjiyan,SHIP,"The Nutrients-class excels in the specialized transportation business. On one hand, it is equipped with armor that puts most destroyers to shame and features a flight deck to counter high-speed frigates. On the other hand, the maintenance and deployment costs are no less than those of a regular military destroyer. In this sector, there is never a shortage of people willing to pay a premium to safeguard their cargo.

Regardless of the era, passive defense is always a delaying tactic. The true value of this ship lies in the fact that unless the entire convoy is destroyed, no one can 'raid and run' with this vessel.",,,,

aEP_FSF,FACTION,"Fast.Safe.Functional Military Corporation is a military enterprise established after the Collapse, primarily engaged in arms sales and ship manufacturing. Its origins trace back to a smuggling organization known for selling military testing prototypes at high prices to various corporations. When the gates went dead, the leadership found themselves trapped in a secret warehouse in the sector. Recognizing that their bodyguards were insufficient to secure the valuable goods in their warehouse, they withdrew from sector conflicts, reestablishing themselves as an underground mercenary organization, thereby forming the precursor to FSF.

During the chaotic early days following the Collapse, FSF secretly hired scientists impacted by the war, aiming to replicate some of the most advanced prototype ships in their possession. Their activities, however, remained largely unknown until just before the onset of the First AI War.

In the golden era following the First AI War, FSF gradually revealed its presence in the fringe worlds by selling ships previously unseen, signaling that FSF had become a notable faction in the sector. They began providing services such as ship manufacturing, military guidance, and arms trade. Despite maintaining the image of a newly developed mega-corporation adhering to Domain-era laws, the recent sharp rise in their fleet size indicates ambitious aspirations.",,,,

Its most notable features are the massive structures on the surface and the grand entrance. Given that FSF did not appear before the First AI War, it's highly likely these structures were built well before the Collapse. The planet was abandoned in the post First AI War period, with its primary functions shifting to large orbital space stations.

The temperature on the planet Lamdor X consistently remains below the operational limits of most equipment. Within two to three years of losing its energy supply, it lost the majority of its population. The only city that survived, where the spaceport is located, managed to endure by relying on antimatter reactors capable of running for centuries. These resources sustained them until they reestablished contact with the core worlds.

Given the tragedy that previously unfolded on this planet, ""better a distant relative than a near neighbor"" became the guiding principle of the local government.

aEP_FSF_Stationplanet,PLANET,"Once protected by a stellar shade array, this place barely sustained a small colony exploiting its abundant mineral resources. Further development plans were halted after the Collapse. Despite the shade array, the planet's surface temperature was still too high to endure. However, the ecologically transformed soil could support some modified crops. Those stranded here hoped that, given enough time, they could gather sufficient supplies to leave the planet.

Everything changed with the arrival of the AI fleet. They maneuvered one of the three stellar shades into a precisely calculated descent orbit, striking the city center with less than a 2km margin of error. Within 30 seconds, 90% of the population was turned to ashes. With the loss of the shade, the temperature doubled, and the radiation environment eradicated the remaining 10%.
