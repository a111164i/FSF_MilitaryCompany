It starts with competing latest domain era reality disturbing weapon, and from now perspective, this weapon deals same level of destruction at 50 times more cost to build, also impossible of mounting on any universal ship slot

To let this gun works properly, first you need disposal drones. Due to massive caliber and weight of warhead, secondary propellants will be ignited by sequence to main high in barrel pressure. After warhead exits muzzle, a formation of electromagnet accelerator drone will drive this projectile to space level velocity. It's been rumored that this weapon can burn sensors just by explosion whiteout, now it's currently serving the company's star fortress.

aEP_cap_duiliu,SHIP,"A recent addition to the sector, this capital ship symbolizes the company power and is a new face compared to the many seasoned designs. For a long time, the company's main warships were designed during the Domain era. Since the FSF, now a force in the sector, it became evident that a warship designed specifically for the corporation was needed. Thus, this ship was born. Sacrificing thick armor and high speed for densely packed weapon slots, when timed right, this ship can annihilate opponents purely through overwhelming firepower. It will represent FSF in a further battle against peer adversaries.

Thermocline, a term for rapid and drastic changes in a short period, in the hands of a brave captain, a single confrontation can lead to victory without the need for boring exchanges. In the narrow contest of battle, only those who believe in their victory will gain the favor of the goddess of victory",,,,
aEP_cap_nuanchi,SHIP,"Looks like randomly install engines on a asteroid factory, the ship indeed lives up to its title of missile capital ship. Scaling up a micro-missile factory to full size comes at an all-encompassing cost. Not only is the redundancy for expanding missile rack squeezed, the space reserved for storing conventional spare ammunition is also occupied. However, with increasing time on the battlefield, the continuous regeneration of missiles from the full-sized missile factory proves its worth.

Unlike its chaotic appearance, the designers take into full consideration the needs of impact mitigation and damage control in its hull structure. Ammunition is stored uniformly, providing not only decent armor but also almost zero possibility of overall self-destruction when damaged.

The ship is also designed to accommodate the 'Refresh' reloading system. This loading device, which uses standardized ammunition supply modules, quickly feeds ammunition from various parts of the hull to the missile launchers, enabling the ship to generate a terrifying volume of launches in a short period. Such a missile ship is awe-inspiring at all times",,,,
aEP_cap_biaobing,SHIP,"If the Paragon-class is a product of the naval fantasies of high-ranking officers and the ambitious aspirations of Tri-tachyon's top echelons, then the Exemplar-class is a solid step towards the generalization of battleships. Unlike the Paragon-class, which spares no expense in using advanced targeting cores, this ship employs a set of shooting-assist radars designed specifically to address the issue of insufficient range for energy weapons.

Despite making significant sacrifices, the Exemplar-class is essentially unable to sustain the radar at full power for an extended period. This means that in one-on-one engagements, most old school ballistic battleships can easily suppress it as long as they maintain an advantageous firing range. Compared to energy warships that require a large number of highly skilled technicians to maintain advanced targeting core cores, the Exemplar-class is more like a return to the traditional battleships of the old, simple and practical.

The Exemplar-class should not appear in the sector because neither the battle group stationed there nor the Fourteenth that came to replace it was equipped with Exemplar-class ships. However, it mysteriously appears on the FSF's inventory. Despite various rumors circulating, one thing is certain: the founders of FSF must have had close ties with certain high-ranking members of the legions before the Collapse, allowing them to acquire blueprint of military grade ships",,,,
aEP_cap_neibo,SHIP,"A battleship cruiser born to hunt down smaller vessels, unlike most of the company's slow but heavily armed ships, it employs a pulse burst propulsion system to propel this big chunk of steel in an instant. Another unique design is the turret module attached to the main gun, featuring independent weapons and flux systems, providing free and guaranteed firing power in close encounters.

Despite being classified as a battleship cruiser, its armor and structure are slightly superior to the company's battleships, making the Thermocline-class somewhat awkward. As a flagship with an alternative design, the abundance of small slots is not good at withstand damage. In evenly matched battles, it is prone to the scenario of 'no guns available.' On the other hand, the massive damage from the main gun is extremely perilous for medium and small ships, posing a challenge for captains in choosing opponents.",,,,
aEP_cap_decomposer,SHIP,"One of the newly developed ships after the Collapse, the Decomposer-class, while carrying a substantial amount of fuel and supplies, is equipped with an open deck and construction yard. The initial design was intended to serve long-range fleets in situations where resupply is unavailable. By dismantling salvaged wreckage on the battlefield for usable parts and various consumables, it significantly alleviates logistical pressures for armies with less efficient logistical systems. In the event of supply shortages, an elite fleet equipped with such ships can sustain itself for a considerable amount of time.

After a ship comes to a stop on the battlefield, if the hull has not completely disintegrated due to self-destruction, many internal components can be recovered. Typically, only after the battle outcome is determined will one side gain the authority to clean up the battlefield. By that time, many items requiring sealed storage may have scattered into space and become unrecoverable. The Decomposer-class equipped with disassembly beams from built-in drones, it can precisely break down wreckage into appropriately sized debris and carry them back to the operation deck for recovery.

To ensure uninterrupted operations, the Decomposer's firepower is sufficient to repel smaller ships. As such, this versatile ship can serve as the core of a small fleet.

Despite using materials for armor and structure that meet military-grade standards, the Decomposer-class sacrifices space for shield generators to meet the requirements of both cargo transport and disassembly operations. Instead, it utilizes an integrated group of shielding drones to absorb damage.",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu,SHIP,"An armored cargo ship traversing the sector, considered only when dealing with the most dangerous routes. The quality of its armor and structure is no less than that of most battleships, allowing it to disregard most threats. As a star in the specialized transport industry, in addition to its formidable firepower, when necessary, it can deploy its armor to withstand a significant amount of firepower until reinforcements arrive.

However, its expensive supply requirements and the effort needed to maintain its folding armor surpass expectations. But that is not the main concern. Its birth, with structural strength compared to military standards, destined it not for routine back-and-forth on peaceful routes. Rather, it belongs to the unpredictable, pirate-infested, environmentally data-lacking border routes where its robust structure is most suited",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu_mk3,SHIP,"This is a modified Upwelling-class, crafted by a departed FSF designer. The modifications involve the removal of the retractable external armor, replaced in the original cargo hold area with a series of gun galleries and auxiliary engines.

The Upwelling-class rarely becomes the target of pirate attacks, or if it does, it rarely ends up being a victim. Since its inception, there have been only a few recorded instances of documented loss events. The appearance of this warship is shrouded in some off-the-record stories. However, it is evident that who created this massive block of modifications is closely align with official standards.",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu_mk2,SHIP,"This is a variant based on the Upwelling-class, designed for transporting antimatter fuel. According to statistical data in the specialized fuel transport business, the risk reduction achieved by minimizing exposure in high-risk areas far outweighs the benefits of adding additional layers of armor. However, the MK.II model opted for both. It is supported by a gigantic driver system formed by the parallel connection of multiple large engines, surpassing any conventional choice in both size and fuel consumption. After a prolonged acceleration phase, it can traverse the battlefield at speeds that can leave destroyers far behind.

The fuel required for the operation of this monster engine is directly sourced from the cargo of the MK.II, resulting in its actual effective payload being lower than the stated value. Although it may consume half of the cargo while crossing hazardous zones, for its clients, successfully reaching the destination intact is already considered a success",,,,

Preferred by top students, the prototype of the Waterfall-class traces back to the reverse engineering of the wreckage of an abandoned aerospace cruiser that was too severely damaged. The study revealed cylindrical tracks and boiler mechanisms believed to be a steam catapult, along with numerous structures resembling a forge.

Through various technological means, including but not limited to an inertia-driven propulsion system that shaking untrained crew members to the point of nausea, and a weapon overload mechanism allowing 30 seconds of firing followed by half an hour of reloading, the company has managed to replicate some of the legendary destroyer's trail.

aEP_FSF,FACTION,"Fast.Safe.Functional Military Corporation is a military enterprise established after the Collapse, primarily engaged in arms sales and ship manufacturing. Its origins trace back to a smuggling organization, known for selling military testing prototypes at high prices to different corporations. As the gates went dead, the leadership found themselves trapped in a secret warehouse in the sector. Recognizing the bodyguards are far from enough to secure valuable goods in their warehouse, they disappeared completely from the sector conflicts, reestablishing themselves as an underground mercenary organization forming the precursor to FSF.

During the chaotic early days of the Collapse, FSF secretly hair scientists impacted by the warfare, aiming to replicate some of the most advanced prototype ships in FSF's possession. Still, their activities remained largely unknown until just before the onset of the First AI War.

In the golden era following the First AI War, FSF gradually revealed its presence on the stage of the fringe worlds by selling ships never seen before, symbolizing FSF had became a notable faction in the sector, providing services such as ship manufacturing, military guidance, and arms trade.
