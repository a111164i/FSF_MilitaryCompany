Location: DWR43 jump point
Date: 201.1.12

"Edge Mapping Fleet 019200, Flagship Icebreaker, Fleet Commander - begin recording. We originally thought the DWR43 system was just a normal blue giant system, but after crossing the jump point we found an unmarked Remnant presence. Immediately after just exiting hyperspace the probe showed several afterglow fleets orbiting the jump point and were in a dormant state."

"Based on data from the Second AI War, activating the fleet's active tracking systems has a greater than 80% chance of causing Remnant units to enter patrol mode, so after a judgment of this fleet's staff council that direct contact with this Remnant fleet is manageable, we have unanimously decided to stay near the jump point and actively destroy these Remnants."

"If the operation goes well, this fleet will use an active scan after resupply and decide on subsequent actions based on the results. End of recording."
