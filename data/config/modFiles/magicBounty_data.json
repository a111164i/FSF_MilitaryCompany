    "job_description": "An urgent bounty issued by the FSF Hidden Factory, targeting the complete eradication of a fleet under the control of the remnants. This fleet was originally a test fleet for an advanced weapons program, planned to engage a small combat group of remnant in a controlled environment, to test the combat effectiveness of the 'Redtide-class dreadnought modernization project' in actual combat. However, there was a serious situation; the remnant mothership significantly raised the level of countermeasures for this battle and dispatched several fleets including main forces to completely cut off our contact with that fleet. According to current communication monitoring, although it has been confirmed that all members of the fleet have been killed, messages like combat orders are still being transmitted between the ships, as if they are still fighting against remnant, which is truly eerie. The mission objective is to eliminate the lost test fleet",
