  "description": "A post collapse funded, planet wise governing military organization provides services like crew training and security guidance, also play as one of the major weapon sellers in the sector. Externally, they adhere the laws left by the Domain era legalising themself as a mega corp, while internally, they are rapidly expanding their military capabilities. Regarded by the outside world as ambitious, they have yet to officially declare their intentions—at least not until now."
